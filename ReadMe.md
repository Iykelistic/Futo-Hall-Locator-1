#### This app helps new students of my school (Futo) find their way around campus

## PROBLEM
Navigating ones way around campus has been a big challenge faced by freshers (New students) in our school FUTO.
This problem can lead to lateness to lectures or even registrations and meetings that are vital for every fresher.

They opt to finding their way around by asking people questions, this could be time consuming and may even place them in the hands of bad people that may take advantage of their ignorance and exploit them in all sort of ways.

## SOLUTION
This app was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript integrating Google maps API to help freshers locate buildings and lecture halls on campus in the easeist way possible
